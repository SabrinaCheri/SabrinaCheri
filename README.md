ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My CS friends inspired me to take the first step in learning coding.
Iâ€™m interested in combining my passion for linguistics with coding to create more opportunities for people to communicate with each other.
Iâ€™m currently learning Python online through a certificate course on codewithmosh.com.
My current goal is to become proficient in Python before moving on to a more specialized language appropriate for language AI.
